    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>2007-2020 ONCR Scout Leader (volunteer)</h2>
    <p>
      Teaching children (11-15 YO) survival techniques, orientation in nature
      and first aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy playing sports (football, basketball), watching documentaries,
      study cases, and different “How-to” videos that I like to put in practice
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also enjoy playing computer games, watching movies and going to the gym
      to unwind and recharge my battery.
